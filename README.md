# Predicting Career Outcomes: The Role of Internships and University Prestige Using Machine Learning

## Authors
- **Enkhgegee Altangerel**: Project Lead, Data Analysis, and Visualization

## Disclaimer
This project was submitted as part of the requirements for **STATS 201: Machine Learning for Social Science**, instructed by **Prof. Luyao Zhang** at **Duke Kunshan University** during the **Autumn 2025** term.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the following contributions:
- **Prof. Luyao Zhang** for guidance and feedback throughout the project.
- Our classmates for insightful discussions and peer reviews.
- **AIGC tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek) for assisting with brainstorming and refining ideas.
- **Open-source software** (e.g., Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP) for enabling data analysis and machine learning.

## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
This project has been a transformative learning experience, allowing us to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world social science problem. Through this project, we:
- Gained hands-on experience with **data preprocessing**, **model development**, and **interpretability techniques** (e.g., SHAP values).
- Developed a deeper understanding of how **internships** and **university prestige** interact to shape career outcomes.
- Enhanced our skills in **data visualization** and **academic writing**, which will be invaluable for future research and professional endeavors.
